# holbertonschool-printf

The goal of this project is to create our own custom printf function
"_printf.c" and man page "man_3_printf".

The printf should be be able to handle string formats
and these conversion specifiers:
c, s, %, d, and i.

## Istallation

To instal this project just copy the line below and clone into your
terminal:

git clone git@github.com:AlexGuadalupe/holbertonschool-printf.git

## Usage 

This project should be able to act and be used like a normal printf 
function should be.

## Flowcharts

These 3 functions are the bases for this project:

 1. Printf: Is the frontend of all the algorithm, so is the prototype, and just receive the variables
 2. Handler: Is the controller for the string and the formats, and also does the counter for the numbers of bytes that are printing
 3. Percent handler: Compare a list of possible specifiers with the current pattern, and return the corresponding function
